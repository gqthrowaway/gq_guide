# Preface
General guidelines for setting up your equipment on the individual level as well as considerations for when working in groups and high performance shooting. The guide aims to get everyone who is not already kitted to a functional baseline with group logistics and value in mind; it also is intended to provide insight once the reader has reached the point of "now what?".

![gang](https://github.com/gqthrowaway/gq_guide/blob/main/Images/urgi02.jpg "")


This guide will also explain the "Why" for those who are interested but this guide will NOT cover or recommend specific equipment for specialized or personalized purposes. 

Towards the end of the guide I will list brands, however it is up to the reader to do the shopping as a lot of recommendations do go on sale and if you need help using Google and online shopping, you are useless to begin with.


### Go get a 14.5 URGI upper, Glock 47 MOS, and a Crye SPC, end of guide.

Kidding, but you are free to take that advice, it's closer to optimal than people think. Continued later on in the guide.

However if you don't want to think at all:

Order of relevance:
1. Pistol 
2. Rifle
3. Belt/Chest Rig
4. Sustainment/Ruck
5. Plate Carrier


Pistol:
- Glock 47 MOS
- Surefire X300-A Turbo
- Trijicon SRO 5MOA
- FCD optic plate for the SRO
- 5 x Glock OEM Magazines
- Tenicor Malus Sol Concealment Holster
- Safariland 6390 RDS holster, mid-ride UBL plate. The Safariland numbering system is asinine and the last number is just what mounting hardware it comes with. Light bearing housing is also irrelevant, 63xx RDS for a Streamlight or Surefire? Doesn't matter, they're the same holster.


Rifle: 
- [14.5 near-clone URGI Upper](https://www.brownells.com/gun-parts/rifle-parts/rifle-receivers-parts/mk16-urg-i-complete-upper-receivers-5.56mm/?sku=430103890)
- Holosun 403R
- Magnifier can come later
- Surefire M640DFT PRO (As of March '24)
- Lower reciever does not matter but I recommend an assembled MILSPEC AERO or BCM lower. Should not cost more than $450 (March '24)
- If your lower does not have a stock or grip, Magpul. Milspec SLS, SLK, or CTR.
- 15 x Magpul Gen 3 PMAGs. 15 is mostly an arbitrary number but 6-8 Magazines is a standard combat load plus a 4~ spares in a pack. On top of that you should have spares on hand if you lose or break any, a 1-2 for your belt, empty training magazines, etc. 
- Blue Force Gear Vickers Sling
- Geissele SSA

  
Load Bearing:
- Crye SPC in Multicam, size yourself; downsize on the Airlite Structural Bund so if you're a medium, get a small bund. If your plate size is a small, get some scissors  for the bund.
- Crye M4 detachable flap (Crye stuff is all compatible so it's likely listed under the AVS suite on the site. I suggest you explore the site.)
- DON'T get the Crye Smart Pouches, they are not that good, because of an autistic feature they are floppy when mounted. The Maritime ones are better because they lack that feature but Spiritus sells a better version overall and has more variety.
- AWS 50657 ASSAULT PACK in Multicam. Alternatives are: AWS 50649, less features but cheaper and the Eagle BTAP/YOTE/Beaver Tail Assault Pack, tons of surplus ones on Ebay but they've going up in price, at current time do not pay more than $220~ and don't get a ratfucked one. T-Rex Arms might have solid color commercial models in stock. 
- T-Rex Arms Quad Flap Chest Rig in Multicam
- T-Rex Arms Speed Belt in Multicam
- 2 x Spiritus or Shaw Concepts Elastic pistol magazine pouches for your belt.
- For individual pouches and everything, that can be discussed later after some time under your equipment but consider what is necessary to carry and where. I will list brands later for your personal research.



# Primary and Secondary Fighting Weapon

## Secondary Weapon

![glock](https://github.com/gqthrowaway/gq_guide/blob/main/Images/glock010.jpg "")

This is probably the most important part of your kit as a civilian, it's the gun you carry day to day and the most likely to be used. Pistols are way harder to master and requires constant dry practice to prevent atrophy; On the bright side, most skills learned under pistol transfer to rifle so a good pistol shooter is generally a good rifle shooter.


Glock 47 with a Surefire X300-A Turbo and SRO, this is the only pistol set up you should consider at the moment.


### "oh but I think x has a better trigger" blow it out your ass, it does not matter

#### You should be thinking about how to shoot a Glock better, not how to buy a crutch. 

There's not a big variance in pistol performance which is why there's no reason to deviate from the ubiquitous Glock.

"Glock: Perfection" is not a hyperbole, if you ever have the time, I recommend reading up on the history behind the Glock and it's inventor. Glock continously has managed to do the most, with the least. It uses the least amount of parts and has had the least amount of internal changes while still being functionally top dog in the pistol world. Only the P320 has come close in recent time as a rival to the Glock and this has only been made true due to lobbying and undercutting the competition as a massively inferior pistol with serious issues that they silently covered up. 

An important part of being a fighting group or at least a group that trains together is uniformity. Parts breakage, familiarity, and compatability with aftermarket as well as each others equipment as a group. You forget a magazine or need to battery? No problem, your buddy has one.

![gang](https://github.com/gqthrowaway/gq_guide/blob/main/Images/glock47example01.jpg "")


19 is compact, don't even consider the 26 subcompact.

17 or the newer 47, normal full sized handgun.

MOS means it's precut for optics however companies offer services to have pistol slides cut if it's not MOS. Some people do that since the optic sits lower, looks better, etc but ultimately it doesn't matter.

If you already have a dedicated carry gun or have a tiny pistol in mind then, in my opinion, a 19 is irrelevant to you. Carrying a full sized glock is fairly easy, the difference in size is not that big but some people just like a smaller gun or just have large balls. Don't think too hard on min-maxing a single pistol that retains most of it's value.

### Pistol Optic

Now to the part where people get hung up, optics for your pistol.

The Trijicon 5MOA SRO as it's the only American made red dot with huge window and long track record. The SRO is a larger window competition variant of the RMR which the current SOCOM standard handgun optic and the RMR has been the most durable dot over time on the market due to a patented housing and glass shape.

People get hung up on getting the perfect dot the first time and start theory crafting nonsense up, but Trijicon is the only company that offers all types of dots all on the same footprint so if you so decide later on you'd prefer a closed dot, no problem, don't even need to buy a new mounting plate. 

## Primary Weapon
Your rifle and sidearm are the basis of you being an effective combatant; this where many fall into folly of making a super personalized rifle and pistol in an attempt to either differentiate or tailor for their environment/usecase when they can barely shoot or move effectively. This mindset is entirely wrong, the miniscule improvements in fancy parts is irrelevant and usually they have their own downsides; US Army Natick Labs, NSWC Crane, JFKSWCS, Range 37, EOTG, Quanitco, FBI, etc all spend billions of your tax dollars in having TBI-riddled service members and pencil-neck melvins research close-to-optimal fighting solutions, whether or not that research is fielded or realized is a different story. 

![gang](https://github.com/gqthrowaway/gq_guide/blob/main/Images/urgi013.jpg "")

### To make this simple, functionally speaking for a 5.56 AR-15, a 14.5 and/or an 11.5 upper and one lower will cover all your basic needs. 16 instead of 14.5 if you want no ATF legal grey area. 

There are other lengths for more specialized guns, namely marksman rifles and .300BO/concealable rifles but these are not a concern for anyone reading this guide at the moment.

14.5/16 is a handy standardized length the military and market has revolved around for multiple decades, without any downsides or weird caveats while being the ideal general purpose length for 5.56. 

11.5 specifically is the min-maxed length for shorter engagements and sits right before lengths like 10.3/5 where potential issues arise regarding suppressor usage, gasing, backpressure, flash, rounds not being as effective, etc.

To make this even simpler, you can directly just copy the 14.5 and 11.5 that SOCOM issues: [M4A1 URG-I or "Upper Reciever Group - Improved"](https://www.brownells.com/gun-parts/rifle-parts/rifle-receivers-parts/mk16-urg-i-complete-upper-receivers-5.56mm/?sku=430103890), if this rifle is good enough America's small teams of professionals that are proficient in full spectrum unconventional warfare, then it's good enough for you. The specifics are not important but it's just a mid-length gas tube, Government profile barrel with a Geissele Mk16 rail. The Super Duty variant is a commerical, debatably "improved" version. How easy! Now when your gang gets all together, there's no lack of interchangability and you'll look like professionals, some might even say "aesthetic". 

However, there is a caveat to the URGI Near Clone upper, it is expensive and but ultimately you'll only save yourself about $300 to build it yourself. While everyone should strive to have the knowledge of assembling and knowing the in's and out's of their personal fighting rifle, not everyone is capable. There is no shame in wanting to pay the premium for a worry-free pre-assembled rifle.

#### With knowledge comes responsibility; DO NOT start min-maxing your rifle build.

[Alternative Upper Suggestion: 14.5 Mid Length BCM Mk2, at current time of March 2024, they are including a free bolt carrier group.](https://bravocompanyusa.com/bcm-mk2-standard-14-5-mid-length-complete-upper-receiver-group-w-raider-m13-handguard/)

Approved Parts List for semi-standardized Rifle:
- Geissele 13.5 MK16
- Geissele Airborne Charging Handle in DDC
- 14.5 Mid Length Government Profile Barrel, Examples: [14.5 Centurion Midweight Hammer Forged Barrel, Midlength](https://centurionarms.com/lightweight-hammer-forged-barrel-midlength/) or [Daniel Defense](https://danieldefense.com/14-5-5-56mm-1-7-gov-profile.html). Get a gas tube, gas block, and A2 muzzle device. Muzzle device will be replaced later on but it's always good to have a spare A2 on hand.
- [CM4 5.56 Forged Upper Receiver](https://centurionarms.com/cm4-5-56-forged-upper-receiver/) Milspec, assembled.
- [CM4 5.56 Forged Lower Receiver](https://centurionarms.com/cm4-5-56-forged-lower-receiver/) Milspec, assembled, no stock.
- [Centurion Bolt Carrier Group](https://centurionarms.com/bolt-carrier-group/) or alternatively a [Colt Bolt Carrier Group](https://armsunlimited.com/colt-ar15-complete-bolt-carrier-group-assembly/),
- H2 weight buffer

Approved Brands for parts:
- FN (They OEM barrels for many companies so ideally do your research)
- BCM
- Magpul
- Aero (avoid their barrels)
- Colt
- Geissele
- Daniel Defense Barrels
- Centurion

To avoid confusion or decision paralysis, the list is intended to be short and only provide what is needed. Microbrands and new start-ups are not on the list to avoid consideration of marketing nonsense and fad items. Also do not buy a civilian spec buffer tube or billet recievers, just stick with milspec forged.

Note: I am not shilling Centurion Arms and I am not affliated in any way. They are high quality and simply sell everything you need which makes it easier for you if everything is in stock. You are free to shop around on your own for the brands I listed. As comparison, Aero recievers are only marginally cheaper and their barrels are not very good. Or if you wanted a comparible barrel from a big brand name like Daniel Defence, FN, or LMT, they'd cost about the same and likely do not include a gas system without an add-on fee.

## Rifle Optics (WIP)

This goes into a separate section as it's much more of a complicated topic.


![gang](https://github.com/gqthrowaway/gq_guide/blob/main/Images/urgi007.jpg "")


Red dot: Eotech, Aimpoint. Holosun if you're cheap, Done.

Magnifier for a red dot: Eotech, everything else at the moment is mediocre, Done.



Magnified optics are where people get into a bunch but I'll break it down for you.

LPVO; generally larger eyeboxes, heavier, variable magnification, battery life is very short.

ACOG; light, small eyeboxes, fixed magnification, both fiber optic/tritium and battery models have illumination that last forever.


Currently the trend favors LPVOs on carbines as they're more versatile with a higher "skill ceiling" but there's merit in a simple optic like the ACOG.

For "serious users" LPVOs are mainly between Vortex's Razor series and Nightforce NX8s or ATACRS.

### Weapon mounted light
At time of writing (March '24):

Rifle: Surefire, Modlite.


Pistol: Surefire, Streamlight.

Do you own research on what model is latest and greatest at the time, do not worry about continuously upgrading because it's really not that different; this applies to most of the guide. 
For switches that aren't OEM; Unity, Surefire. Albeit the caveat is that switches can be unreliable due to the design of the plug but a button on the back will basically never fail.
