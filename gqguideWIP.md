# Preface
General guidelines for setting up your equipment on the individual level as well as considerations for when working in groups and high performance shooting. 
This guide will also explain the "Why" for those who are interested but this guide will NOT cover equipment for specialized or personalized purposes. 

Towards the end of the guide I will list brands, however it is up to the reader to do the shopping and if you need help using Google and online shopping, you are useless to begin with.


### Go get a 14.5 Super Duty and a Crye SPC, end of guide.

Kidding, but you are free to take that advice, it's closer to optimal than people think. Continued later on in the guide.

However if you don't want to think at all:

Rifle: 
- 14.5 Super Duty in DDC
- Holosun 403R
- Magnifier can come later
- Surefire M640DFT PRO (As of March '24)
- If your lower does not have a stock or grip, Magpul. Milspec SLS, SLK, or CTR.
- Geissele SSA
- 10 x Magpul Gen 3 PMAGs

Pistol:
- Glock 47 MOS
- Surefire X300 Turbo
- Trijicon SRO
- FCD optic plate for the SRO
- Tenicor Malus Sol Concealment Holster
- Safariland 6390 RDS holster, mid-ride UBL plate. The Safariland numbering system is asinine and the last number is just what mounting hardware it comes with. Light bearing housing is also irrelevant, 63xx RDS for a Streamlight or Surefire? Doesn't matter, they're the same holster.

Load Bearing:
- Crye SPC in Multicam, size yourself; downsize on the Airlite Structural Bund so if you're a medium, get a small bund. If your plate size is a small, get some scissors  for the bund.
- Crye M4 detachable flap (Crye stuff is all compatible so it's likely listed under the AVS suite on the site. I suggest you explore the site.)
- DON'T get the Crye Smart Pouches, they are not that good, because of an autistic feature they are floppy when mounted. The Maritime ones are better because they lack that feature.
- AWS 50657 ASSAULT PACK in Multicam 
- T-Rex Arms Quad Flap Chest Rig in Multicam
- T-Rex Arms Speed Belt in Multicam
- 2 x Spiritus or Shaw Concepts Elastic pistol magazine pouches for your belt.
- For individual pouches and everything, that can be discussed later after some time under your equipment but consider what is necessary to carry and where. I will list brands later for your personal research.



# Primary and Secondary Fighting Weapon

## Primary Weapon
Your rifle and sidearm are the basis of you being an effective combatant; this where many fall into folly of making a super personalized rifle and pistol in an attempt to either differentiate or tailor for their environment/usecase when they can barely shoot or move effectively. This mindset is entirely wrong, the miniscule improvements in fancy parts is irrelevant and usually they have their own downsides; US Army Natick Labs, NSWC Crane, JFKSWCS, Range 37, EOTG, FBI, etc all spend billions of your tax dollars in having TBI-riddled service members and melvins research close-to-optimal fighting solutions, whether or not that research is fielded or realized is a different story. 

### To make this simple, functionally speaking for a 5.56 AR-15, a 14.5 and/or an 11.5 upper and one lower will cover all your basic needs. 16 instead of 14.5 if you want no ATF legal grey area. 

There are other lengths for more specialized guns, namely marksman rifles and .300BO/concealable rifles but these are not a concern for anyone reading this guide at the moment.

The reasoning behind 11.5 and 14.5/16 is that they're standardized lengths, so rails are generally designed with these lengths in mind. 

14.5/16 is a handy standardized length the military and market has revolved around for multiple decades, without any downsides or weird caveats while being the ideal general purpose length for 5.56. 

11.5 specifically is the min-maxed length for shorter engagements and sits right before lengths like 10.3/5 where potential issues arise regarding suppressor usage, gasing, backpressure, flash, rounds not being as effective, etc.

To make this even simpler, you can directly just copy the 11.5 and 14.5 that SOCOM issues; behold the M4A1 URG-I or "Upper Reciever Group - Improved"; the specifics are not important but it's basically just a Government profile upper with a Geissele Mk16 rail. The Super Duty variant is a commerical, slightly improved version. The reciever does not really matter. How easy! Now when your gang gets all together, there's lack of interchangability and you'll look like professionals, some might even say "aesthetic". 



## Secondary Weapon
Glock with a Surefire X300 Turbo.

"oh but I think x has a better trigger" blow it out your ass it does not matter, the differences are negligible or the alternative has it's own faults.

The important part of being a fighting group or at least a group that trains together is uniformity. Parts breakage, familiarity, and compatability with aftermarket as well as each others equipment as a group. You forget a magazine or battery? No problem, your buddy has one.

19 is compact, don't even consider the 26 subcompact.

17 or the newer 47, normal full sized handgun.

MOS means it's precut for optics.

Now to the part where people get hung up, optics for your pistol. Trijicon, Leupold DPP, Aimpoint, Holosun, those are the only brands you need to consider. 

If you already have a dedicated carry gun or have a tiny pistol in mind then a 19 is irrelevant to you. Carrying a full sized glock is also fairly easy, the difference in size is not that big so don't think too hard on min-maxing.


## Primary Optic


Red dot: Eotech, Aimpoint. Holosun if you're cheap, Done.

Magnifier for a red dot: Eotech, everything else at the moment is mediocre, Done.



Magnified optics are where people get into a bunch but I'll break it down for you.

LPVO; generally larger eyeboxes, heavier, variable magnification, battery life is very short.

ACOG; light, small eyeboxes, fixed magnification, both fiber optic/tritium and battery models have illumination that last forever.


Currently the trend favors LPVOs on carbines as they're more versatile with a higher "skill ceiling" but there's merit in a simple optic like the ACOG.

For "serious users" LPVOs are mainly between Vortex's Razor series and Nightforce NX8s or ATACRS.

### Weapon mounted light
At time of writing (March '24):

Rifle: Surefire, Modlite.


Pistol: Surefire, Streamlight.

Do you own research on what model is latest and greatest at the time, do not worry about continuously upgrading because it's really not that different; this applies to most of the guide. 
For switches that aren't OEM; Unity, Surefire. Albeit the caveat is that switches can be unreliable due to the design of the plug but a button on the back will basically never fail.
